SOP: Managing Email Addresses for Person Accounts (Contact Point Email Records)
Objective
This SOP explains how to correctly set, update, and manage email addresses for Person Accounts using two supported methods:
Directly editing the Email field on the Person Account


Creating or modifying Contact Point Email records


Salesforce enforces specific rules around primary email addresses and the synchronization between a Person Account’s Email field and the Primary Contact Point Email record.
Behind the scenes, multiple Record-Triggered Flows manage:
Automatic creation of Contact Point Email records


Syncing the main Email field with the Primary record


Validation of Primary status


Timestamping (“Active From”)


Enforcement of data integrity rules


This SOP ensures consistent data entry and reduces errors by explaining how the automation behaves and what users should expect.

Context: How Automation Works
Salesforce uses Contact Point Email records to track the lifecycle of all email addresses associated with a person. Record-triggered flows run whenever a user:
Edits the main Person Account Email field
Creates or updates a Contact Point Email record
Changes which email is marked Primary


These flows are responsible for:
1. Sync Logic
Creating Contact Point Email records when the Person Account Email field is set
Setting Active From automatically when not provided
Updating the Person Account’s Email field when a new Primary is selected
Ensuring only one Contact Point Email can be Primary at a time


2. Validation Logic
Preventing users from clearing the Primary email if other active emails exist
Ensuring the Primary email is always reflected in the Person Account Email field


3. Data Integrity
Supporting multiple email types (personal, work, secondary)
Allowing historical emails to remain on record without requiring end dates
Allowing backdating of Active From when needed
Ensuring accurate downstream behavior for communication and AI features


Key Steps
1. Setting the Email Directly on the Person Account
Open a Person Account.
Enter an email address in the Email field.
Click Save.


Automation Behavior
A new Contact Point Email record is automatically created.
Active From defaults to today’s date.
The new record is automatically marked Primary.
The system syncs the Person Account's Email field to that primary record.


2. Creating a New Contact Point Email Record
Go to the Related tab on the Person Account.
Scroll to Contact Point Email.
Click New.
Enter:


Email address
Email Type (e.g., Personal, Work)
Optional: Active From (you may backdate this)
Optional: Primary checkbox
Click Save.


Automation Behavior
If Primary is selected →
 Flows update the Person Account Email field to this new value.
If Primary is NOT selected →
 The email is stored but does NOT change the Person Account Email.
If Active From is left blank →
 A flow automatically sets it to today.


This allows you to store secondary or historical emails without affecting the main contact email.

3. Updating the Primary Email
Users have two options:
Option A — Make an Existing Email the Primary
Open the desired Contact Point Email record.
Check Primary.
Save.


Automation Behavior
The Person Account’s Email field updates to this new primary.
The previous Primary record is automatically unselected.
Active From stays as-is unless manually changed.


Option B — Create a NEW Primary Email
Create a new Contact Point Email record.
Check Primary.
Leave Active From blank if you want it to default to today.
Save.


Automation Behavior
The Person Account Email reflects this new address immediately.
The system timestamps the new record with Active From = today.
The old Primary is unselected automatically.


Cautionary Notes
Do not attempt to directly manipulate the Person Account Email field to bypass Primary logic—flows will override your change via the Contact Point Email records.
Only one Contact Point Email can be Primary at a time; flows enforce this.
Leaving Active From blank is appropriate when the start date should be “today.”
Use Contact Point Email records when maintaining multiple emails (work, personal, secondary) without changing the primary.
Tips for Efficiency
Use Contact Point Email records for historical accuracy, such as when a person changes workplaces or personal email providers.
Backdate Active From only when needed—for example, when cleaning up legacy data.
Always verify which email is Primary to understand what appears on the Person Account Email field.
If an email on the Person Account “doesn’t look right,” check:
Which Contact Point Email is Primary
Whether a new record was created with Primary checked
